                            SoundIt! was created by Thien Linh, Cong Quyen, Van Tung during the Summner 2020 July 
                            at the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology. <br><br>
                            This is our semester project and the goal was to design and develop a project of our own choice and 
                            spend about 2 weeks producing it. SoundIt! Was proposed by Qualen as an interactive social media 
                            experience combining Sound Cloud with a Reddit style interface. This was accomplished via the Ruby 
                            on Rails framework after spending this frist project of the semester enjoing using the Ruby programming
                            language.
